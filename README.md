Project Title
Bikeshare Project

Description
This project makes use of python to understand U.S bikeshare data.The U.S. bikeshare data contains information relating to bike share systems for 
three major cities in the United States â€” Chicago, New York City, and Washington. Using Python, I will write a code import the data and answer interesting 
questions about it by computing. It is an interactive environment where a user chooses the data, filters a dataset to get statistics on these three different cities.
